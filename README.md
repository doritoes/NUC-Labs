# NUC-Labs

The original NUC Labs were hosted on a wiki, UncleNuc.com. However this site was retired in September 2025 due to funding limitations. Labs are a series of hands-on learning projects that provide exposure to multiple advanced technologies. The focus is on using automation to build and scale applications and workloads in a low-cost lab environment. The star of the show? The Intel NUC.

This repository is for building and managing a NUC lab using Ansible.
