# Set Up Application
We are going to deploy a demonstration web app using an image downloaded from hub.docker.com. We will demonstrate using HAProxy in front of the web application on Kubernetes.

Overview:
- Nginx and PHP-FPM on Alpine Linux minimalist image from https://github.com/TrafeX/docker-php-nginx
- This image has the mysqli driver enabled but the PDO driver for mysql is disabled
  - PDO is the modern way to interfaces with of the various databases out there with minimal coding changes
  - *See https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_mysql_connect.asp*
- We created our own image with PDO support: https://github.com/doritoes/docker-php-nginx-app-server
  - This image installs php83-pdo_mysql and enables the pdo_mysql extension
- Our simple demonstration app is built on the base driver without PDO support, and will use mysqli
  - Source:https://github.com/doritoes/k8s-php-demo-app
  - Image: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/doritoes/k8s-php-demo-app
- This application does not use HTTPS. It is HTTP only.
  - Obviously don't use this in production as leaks credentials!
  - HOWEVER, may web applications are rolled these days without https because they are only accessible by a load balancer or reverse proxy that has the TLS certificate installed. The security is performed by the load balancer meaning the actual pods don't have the https overhead and complexity.

## Create Deployment
We are doing to create 2 pods and have them created on our ‚Äúworker‚Äù nodes. Our demonstration app includes both liveness and readiness check URLs.

`k8s-deployment-web.yml`

## Create Service
Now we are going to expose the application to beyond the node.
`k8s-service-web.yml`

## Create Ansible Playbook to Deploy the Web App
Create Ansible playbooks to create and remove the web application containers.

`deploy-web.yml`

`destroy-web.yml`

## Deploy the Web Application
## Test the Web Application
## Configure HA Proxy
### Create the haproxy.cfg.j2 Template
`haproxy.cfg.j2`
### Install HAProxy
`haproxy-install.yml`
### TestHAProxy
### Optionally Remove the NodePort
`k8s-service-web.yml`
## Scaling
## Learn More
### Load Testing
### Confirm Liveness Tests are Working
### What If...?
