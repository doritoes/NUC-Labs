# Host Installation and Configuration
You will need to set up a large-ish Ubuntu system. This will be home to the Oracle VirtualBox virtual machines (VM's). You can use any Ubuntu system, but you get points for using a NUC. This system will also be the Ansible controller for this lab.

## Install Ubunutu 22.04 Desktop
The first step is to install Ubuntu 22.04 Desktop on the host system. It's a good idea to use a ‚Äúminimal installation‚Äù of Ubuntu for this Lab. If you need help with this step, see the tutorial below. Since this is a Lab, sometimes break and it's really helpful to be able to use the Oracle VirtualBox GUI to access the consoles of your VMs.
