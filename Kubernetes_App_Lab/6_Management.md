# Management
In this step we look at deploying different application images
- doritoes/k8s-php-demo-app:blue
- doritoes/k8s-php-demo-app:green
- doritoes/k8s-php-demo-app:orange

Strategies supported by Kubernetes out of the box:
- rolling deployment (default) - replaces pods running the older version with the new version one-by-one
- recreate deployment - terminates all pods and replaces them with the new version
 - ramped slow rollout - very safe and slow rollout
- best-effort controlled rollout - fast and lower overhead but run during a maintenance window

Strategies that requires customization or specialized tools:
- blue/green deployment
- canary deployment
- shadow deployment
- A/B testing

## Rolling Deployment
Open a second terminal or ssh session.  You will watch the status of your deployment here.
- `watch -d -n 1 'kubectl get pods,deploy'

### Update the Image in k8s-deployment-web.yml
- edit `k8s-deployment-web.yml`
  - modify `image  to use the new image tag
    - `image: doritoes/k8s-php-demo-app:green`

### Kick Off the Update
This process will perform a one-by-one replacement. Health checks (liveness and readiness) ensure new pods are healthy before taking old ones offline.

#### Option 1 - Run Ansible playboook
`ansible-playbook deploy-web.yml`

#### Option 2 - Apply Kubernetes manifest
`kubectl apply -f k8s-deployment-web.yml`

#### Observe the Rollout
Observe the rollout status:
- `kubectl rollout status deployment/web-deployment`

Watch the status in the other session.
- What can you see happening?
- What userful information is missing?

Examine the deployment and see which image is running:
- `kubectl describe deployment/web-deployment`

Here are two ways to get the images running on all pods:
- `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{"\n"}{.metadata.name}{":\t"}{range .spec.containers[*]}{.image}{", "}{end}{end}' | sort`
- `kubectl get pods -o wide`

### Testing and Troubleshooting
Load the web app now (either by nodePort or by updating the HAProxy config)
- You may need to press F5 or Control F5 to refresh the style sheet-
- The color of the app should now be green

If the rollout is stalled, use these commands to investigate potential issues:
- `kubectl describe deployment web-deployment`
- `kubectl get pods`
- `kubectl logs <pod-name>`

### Rollback
Roll back the update:
- `kubectl rollout undo deployment/web-deployment`

Observe the rollback:
- `kubectl rollout status deployment/web-deployment`
- Watch the status in the other session

Examine the deployment and see which image is running:
- `kubectl describe deployment/web-deployment`
- Load the web app again and Control-F5/reload to refresh the CSS formatting.
- The color should be back to blue

## Improvements
You can customize the rolling deployment behavior within your Deployment spec with the `maxSurge` and `maxUnavailable` properties.

For example here is adding the ability to add up to 25% of the desired number of pods and ensuring you never drop before the desired number of pods.

~~~~
spec:
  replicas: 2 
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 25%  # Can exceed the desired number of pods
      maxUnavailable: 0  # No downtime during the update 
  # ... rest of your deployment specification ...
~~~~

## Replace Deployment
This is the ungraceful method to kill all pods and re-create them with no concern as to update. We will deploy the "orange" image this time.

If it is not still running, restart the second session watching the pods and deployment:
- `watch -d -n 1 'kubectl get pods,deploy'`

### Update Deploy Strategy
- Create `k8s-replace-web.yml` from [k8s-replace-web.yml](k8s-replace-web.yml)
  - Optionally, you could just modify `k8s-deployment-web.yml` to add a section:
    - `strategy:`
    - `  type: Recreate`
- Apply the manifest: `kubectl apply -f k8s-replace-web.yml`

- edit `k8s-deployment-web.yml`
  - modify `image  to use the new image tag
    - `image: doritoes/k8s-php-demo-app:green`

### Kick Off the Update
`kubectl apply -f k8s-deployment-web.yml`

#### Observe the Rollout
Observe the rollout status:
- `kubectl rollout status deployment/web-deployment`

After it's done, examine the image that is running.
- `kubectl describe deployment/web-deployment`

### Testing and Troubleshooting
Load the web app now (either by nodePort or by updating the HAProxy config)
- You may need to press F5 or Control F5 to refresh the style sheet-
- The color of the app should now be orange

### Rollback
Roll back the update:
- `kubectl rollout undo deployment/web-deployment`

Observe the rollback:
- `kubectl rollout status deployment/web-deployment`
- Watch the status in the other session
- What method is used for the rollback?
- View the rollout history
  - `kubectl rollout history deployment/web-deployment`
  - Is this history empty? What changed each time you rolled back?

Examine the deployment and see which image is running:
- `kubectl describe deployment/web-deployment`
- Load the web app again and Control-F5/reload to refresh the CSS formatting.
- The color should be back to blue

Try updating `k8s-deployment-web.yml` to update the image:
- `doritoes/k8s-php-demo-app:blue`
- `doritoes/k8s-php-demo-app:green`
- `doritoes/k8s-php-demo-app`
- `doritoes/k8s-php-demo-app:orange`
- `doritoes/k8s-php-demo-app:latest`
- Each time apply using `ansible-playbook deploy-web.yml`

View the rollout history:
- kubectl rollout history deployment/web-deployment

Pick a revision number and view the details:
- `kubectl rollout history deployment/web-deployment --revision=<revision-number>`

NOTE on Revision numbering. The reason your revision numbers seem out of order could be due to a few factors:
- Rollbacks: If you performed rollbacks using kubectl rollout undo, the rolled-back version gets assigned a new, higher revision number.
- Manual Manifest Change: Manually editing the deployment's pod template using kubectl edit also generates a new revision
- Failed Deployments: Sometimes, if the deployment process fails, a new revision could be created even if no new pods were successfully launched

## Kubernetes Dashboard
The Kubernetes Dashboard is a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) built into Kubernetes. This provides a comprehensive overview of the cluster and facilitates basic tasks.
### Install
Deploy the dashboard
- `kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.7.0/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml`

### Create Service Account
Create a service account and bind the `cluster-admin` role to it
- `kubectl create serviceaccount dashboard -n kubernetes-dashboard`
- `kubectl create clusterrolebinding dashboard-admin -n kubernetes-dashboard  --clusterrole=cluster-admin  --serviceaccount=kubernetes-dashboard:dashboard`
