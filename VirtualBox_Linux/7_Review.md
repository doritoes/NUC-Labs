Here are some challenges to try:
- Build the Host as a server with no GUI interface for VirtualBox
  - How much harder is troubleshooting without the GUI?
- Try configuring another application on the your VMs
  - FAH
  - Kubernetes
  - Hashtopolis
  - Meme Generator App (https://github.com/mokoshalb/Meme-Maker-PHP/blob/master/README.md)
    - Bonus points for deploying it as a load balanced Kubernetes App (because you have to deal with a SQL server)
