# Review
Congratulations on completing this Lab! You successfully used a variety of technologies:
- Ubuntu desktop
- Ansible
- Oracle VirtualBox
- Ubuntu Server unattended installation
- Deploy a fleet of Ubuntu server VMs into VirtualBox using unattended installation
- Loaded a demonstration web app

# Learn More
Would you like to see a more complex deployment of an actual container-based web application on Kubernetes
- Check out [Kubernetes App Lab](/Kubernetes_App_Lab/README.md)

What else can you use this Lab for? Here are some challenges to try:
- Build the Host as a server with no GUI interface for VirtualBox
  - How much harder is troubleshooting without the GUI?
- Try configuring another application on the your VMs
  - FAH
  - Kubernetes
  - Hashtopolis
  - Meme Generator App (https://github.com/mokoshalb/Meme-Maker-PHP/blob/master/README.md)
    - Bonus points for deploying it as a load balanced Kubernetes App (because you have to deal with a SQL server)
