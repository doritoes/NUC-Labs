‚ö†Ô∏è If you install Ubuntu Server with the minimalized package installation, the FAH client installation fails.

dpkg: error processing package fahclient (--install):

Therefore do a normal (<ins>not minimal</ins>) installation of Ubuntu server. I have not been able to track down what package are missing/required.

## Configure the Client
The FAH client configuration is stored at:
- ` /etc/fahclient/config.xml`

To update this file:
- Modify the file using sudo permissions
  - `sudo vi  /etc/fahclient/config.xml`
- Restart the client service
  - `sudo systemctl stop FAHClient`
  - `sudo systemctl start FAHClient`

You can view an example of a configuration file at [config.xml](config.xml)

I recommend you register for a passkey

- Edit the config.xml file and restart FAHClient
