# proxmox Lab
The mission in this Lab is to set up a virtual Lab environment hosted on a NUC running proxmox. This replaces the previous Lab running on ESXi, which is not longer an option for home labs after the Broadcom acquisition of VMware.

Why it's perfect to the lab:
- ProxmoxVE is super-flexible and feature-rich, perfect for the Lab

Mission:
- Bare metal installation on the NUC
- Set up guest VMs
- Set up LXD containers
- Test automation that is available

Left to do:
- Everything

Out of scope:
- Still scoping

IMPORTANT:
- Post important gotchas, limitations, "before you start" notes

Materials:
- Lab router  providing DHCP and internet access
- NUC
  - NUC10FNH (BXNUC10i7FNH1) ([specs](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/intel-nuc/NUC10i357FN_TechProdSpec.pdf))
  - 32GB RAM (64GB max)
  - 2TB SSD
  - TIP From BIOS disable the SDHC card slot; ðŸŒ± does proxmox have drivers for it? XCP-ng didn't
  - TIP Running a hypervisor and the NUC might be a reason to disable the feature to disable the "Fan off when cool" feature; by default the fan will stop for temperatures under 40C
- USB sticks
  - 1 USB stick 8GB or more for installation of proxmox

## Install VMs on LAN

## Install OPNsense firewall

Does we need to do this for proxmox? Be sure to <ins>disable TX checksumming</ins> on the network interfaces connected to the firewall as noted.
