# Appendix - Ansible Configuring Check Point Lab
This appendix follows the next steps after completing [Appendix - Terraform and XCP-ng](Appendix-Terraform.md). Now that the VMs are created, it's time to prepare them for the next step, configuring and managing using Ansible.

Notes:
- The Linux-based VM templates have the user `ansible` created. SSH with RSA keys still needs to be enabled.

# Build the Environment using Terraform
- `terraform plan`
- `terraform apply -auto-approve`

# Configure Management Workstation
- From XO, click on `manager`
  - Note the network is configured for two interfaces
    - First one: `Pool-wide network associated with eth0`
      - allows downloading and installing software and packages
      - will be disabled (or completely removed) after Branch 1 configuration is complete
    - Second one: `branch1mgt`
- Log in to the console of `manager`
- Optionally, from the app store install "Windows Terminal" by Microsoft
  - this makes it easy to switch between CMD, Powershell, and WSL shells
  - Open Microsoft Store, update it if required
  - Install **Windows Terminal**
  - Open Terminal and note the dropdown to select which terminal(s) you want to open
- Rename the PC to `manager`
  - From administrative powershell
    - `Rename-Computer -NewName manager`
    - `Restart-Computer`
- Install WSL
  - Add optional feature Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
    - NOTE In Lab testing, skipping this step caused problems
    - Start > type "Add an optional feature", click it
    - Scroll to bottom, click **More Windows features**
    - Check **Windows Subsystem for Linux** and click **OK**
    - Click **Restart now**
  - Log back in and open a privileged shell
    - `wsl --list`
    - `wsl --list --online`
    - `wsl --install -d Ubuntu-22.04`
      - feel free to customize
      - A new WSL window is opened and you are promped set the username and password
        - Username: `ansible`
        - NOTE if it sticks at *Installing, this may take a few minutes...*, <ins>press Control-C and it will continue</ins>, prompting you to set the username and password
- Configure Network interfaces
  - **Settings** > **Network & Internet**
  - **Click Ethernet** > **First Interface** (connected)
    - Network profile: **Private**
  - Click **Ethernet** > **Second Interface** (No Internet)
    - IP assigment: Click **Edit**
    - From dropdown select **Manual**
    - Slide to enable **IPv4**
      - We cannot set the IP address without a gateway IP or DNS from this interface!
  - Click **Start** > **Settings** > **Network & Interface** > **Ethernet**
    - Click **Change adapter options**
    - Open the adapter (i.e., **Ethernet 3**) with "Unidentified network"
    - Click **Properties**
    - Double-click **Internet Protocol Version 4** (TCP/IPv4)
    - Change to "Use the following IP address"
      - Use the following IP address:
        - IP address: **192.168.41.100**
        - Subnet mask: **255.255.255.0**
        - Gateway: Leave empty
        - Leave DNS entries empty
        - Click **OK**
      - Click **OK**
    - Click **Close**
- Install additional Windows applications
  - [Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
  - [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php)
- This is a good time to change your display resolution to 1440 x 900 or your resolution of choice
- Install additional WSL packages
  - `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove -y`
  - `sudo apt install -y software-properties-common python3-paramiko python3-pip`
  - Install Ansible
    - Option 1 - recommended - Ansbile 2.17 (or later)
      - `sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible`
      - `sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ansible`
      - `ansible --version`
      - Normally installing with ppa method is discouraged; this is is easiest way to get current ansible for automation
    - Option 2 - Ubuntu 22.04 old Ansible 2.10
      - `sudo apt install -y ansible`
      - `ansible --version`
  - Install ansible collections
    - `ansible-galaxy collection install community.general vyos.vyos check_point.mgmt check_point.gaia`
    - `ansible-galaxy collection install check_point.mgmt --force`
  - Install XenAPI python package
    - `python3 -m pip install XenAPI`
- Generate ssh RSA key for user `ansible`
  - Open WSL terminal (Start > search WSL, or open Windows Terminal and click the dropdown carrot and click Ubuntu)
  - `ssh-keygen -o`
    - <ins>Do not</ins> enter a passphrase
    - Accept all defaults (press enter)
  - The public key you will be using:
    - `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
- Set up basic configuration files for Ansible
  - Create `ansible.cfg` from [ansible.cfg](ansible/ansible.cfg)
  - Create `inventory` from [inventory](ansible/inventory)
    - Note the values are commented out; we will confirm and enable these IPs later in the Lab
    - Under `[router]` you will put the Lab IP address of the router
      - This will be configured in the next step
      - And yes, the simulated Internet IP; the inside interface won't be accessible until later

# Configure VyOS Router
- Open the `vyos` router VM and log in to console
- Configure eth0 interface
  - `configure`
  - `set interfaces ethernet eth0 address dhcp`
  - `set service ssh`
  - `commit`
  - `save`
  - `exit`
  - Get the IP address on eth0
    - `show interfaces ethernet eth0 brief`
- From `manager` VM configure key login in VyOS
  - Log in to VyOS as `ansible`
    - `ssh ansible@<vyos_lab_ip>`
    - accept the key
    - log in with password
  - `configure`
  - `set system login user ansible authentication public-keys home type 'ssh-rsa'`
  - `set system login user ansible authentication public-keys home key '<valueofkey>'`
    - paste in contents of the id_rsa.pub file on manager <ins>without the leading `ssh-rsa`</ins>
  - `commit`
  - `save`
  - `exit`
- Test Ansible access
  - `exit`
  - Retry: `ssh ansible@<vyos_lab_ip>`
    - no longer requies a password
  - Edit the `inventory` files to add the IP address of the router below `[router]`
  - the `inventory` files should have the VyOS "public" IP without the "#" comment character
  - everything else should be "commented out"
  - `ansible all -m ping`
  - You are expecting `SUCCESS` and `"ping": "pong"`
- Configure router using Ansible
  - Create router.yml from [router.yml](ansible/router.yml)
  - `ansible-playbook router.yml`
  - Testing
    - Login in to the VyOS router
    - `show interfaces`
    - Spin up a temporary VM based on template `win10-template` on the **build** network
      - it should be get DHCP information and be able to connect to the Internet

# Configure SMS
Steps:
- In XO, select the VM `SMS`
- Under Network tab, set the network interface settings to disable TX checksumming
- Log in to console of SMS
  - Username `admin` and the password you selected
- Set IP address information
  - `set interface eth0 ipv4-address 192.168.41.20 mask-length 24`
  - `save config`
- Log in to `manager` and open a WSL shell
  - `ssh ansible@192.168.41.20`
    - you will be in the default home directory `/home/ansible`
- Create new authorized_keys file and add the key
  - `mkdir .ssh`
  - `chmod u=rwx,g=,o= ~/.ssh`
  - `touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
  - `chmod u=rw,g=,o= ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
  - Add the public key from `manager` to the files
    - `cat > ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
      - paste in the key
      - press Control-D
  - `exit`
  - You can now ssh without a password
    - `ssh 192.168.41.20`
- Test Ansible access
  - Exit back to session on manager
  - update file `inventory`, uncomment to IP of the SMS 192.168.41.20
    - leave the variable intact
  - `ansible all -m ping`
    - You are expecting `SUCCESS` and `"ping": "pong"` for 192.168.41.20
    - the router should also respond `SUCCESS`
- Create files on the manager (variables file, playbook to create SMS, and the jinja template for the SMS)
  - [vars.yml](ansible/vars.yml)
  - [sms.yml](ansible/sms.yml)
  - [sms.j2](ansible/sms.j2)
  - [sms-user.j2](ansible/sms-user.j2)
- Run the playbook to complete the first time wizard (FTW), reboot, and add the user "ansible" to the SMS's managment database
  - `ansible-playbook sms.yml`
    - This takes a long time
    - Uses `config_system` tool to perform FTW
    - Creates user `ansible` using `mgmt_cli`
      - Creating the user directly using the ansible module `add-administrator` isn't working correctly as of this writing
    - Allows all IP addresses to connect to the API in our Lab environment
  - Testing
    - Log in to `sms` console (or ssh)
      - `fwm ver`
      - Should say *Check Point Management Server R81.20*
    - `api status`
- Log in to `sms` Web gui from `manager`
  - https://192.168.41.20
  - Download the SmartConsole R81.20 client using the link "Download Now!"
- Install SmartConsole using the downloaded file
- Launch SmartConsole
  - Username: `cpadmin`
  - Password: *the password from vars.yml (default Checkpoint123!)*
  - Server Name or IP Address: **192.168.41.20**
  - Accept the server identity and click **Proceed**
  - After a short time, the SmartConsole app will prompt you to click **Relaunch Now** to apply the latest updates
    - In Lab testing sometimes a pop-up error appeared after trying to launch while staying logged in
      - "Application has experienced a serious problem and must close immediately"
      - Click **OK** and continue using the application normally
- Update Gaia (if you have proper eval licenses)
  - Wait until the Branch 1 firewalls are configured and providing Internet access
  - A valid license is required for downloads and updates (the 15-day trial license does not meet this requriement); however once Internet access is working, you can use CPUSE to apply jumbo hotfixes
  - SMS updates are best applied manually (whereas firewalls are updated using management API)
    - clish
      - installer check-for-updates
      - installer download [tab]
      - installer install [tab]
    - Web GUI > Upgrades (CPUSE)
- Create objects in the Check Point database related to management
  - Create files on the manager (inventory, playbook)
    - [inventory-api](ansible/inventory-api)
      - Customize to update the credentials as needed
      - Lab testing to move the login credentials to the playbook was not successful in Ansibile 2.10.8
      - Starting Ansible 2.11, use new `include_vars` to include the var.yml and use the credentials from there
    - [management-objects.yml](ansible/management-objects.yml)
  - `ansible-playbook -i inventory-api management-objects.yml`
  - In SmartConsole press Control-E to open the Object explorer
    - Expand Network Objects
    - Note that the new hosts and network appear when you select Networks and/or Hosts 

Note:
- To reset and re-run the FTW on this management server, remove the following files:
  - `/etc/.wizard_accepted`
  - `/etc/.wizard_started`
  - `$FWDIR/conf/ICA.crl`
  - `$FWDIR/conf/InternalCA.*`

## HTTPS Inspection
- branch1-https.yml [branch1-https.yml](ansible/branch1-https.yml)
  - creates the certificate
- Non-ansible/manual solutions here since ansible check_point.mgmt doesn't support all the commands until R82
  - creating https rules, etc not supported until R82
  - some outbound certificate commands function differently pre-R82
  - enable-https-inspection will be added in the next version
- Export the certificate using SmartConsole gui
- Enable HTTPS inspection in SmartConsole gui
- Import the https inspection certificate on DC-1
  - copy the .cer file to `c:\certificate.cer`
  - create the GPO  
    - `$OU = "OU=Corp,DC=xpcng,DC=lab"`
    - `$gpoName = "Distribute Root CA Certficate"`
    - `$ouPath = "OU=Corp,DC=xpcng,DC=lab"`
    - `New-GPO -Name $gpoName | New-GPLink -Target $ouPath`
  - Open Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)
    - Start > Group Policy Management
    - Forest: xcpng.lab
    - Domain: xcpng.lab
    - OU: Distribute Root CA Certication
    - Right click the OU from the tree, and click Edit
    - In the console tree, open Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Public Key Policies
    - Right-click Trusted Root Certification Authorities, and then click Import
      - Import `c:\certificate.cer`
  - Test from branch1-1
    - "gpupdate /force" will trigger an update
    - logging out and back in may also help
    - When browsing to an https site, examine the certificate to confirm the signing authority is the firewall
    - When browsing to a blocked site, the UserCheck message will have an untrusted certificate until we import it
    - Examine logs
  - 🌱 need to add more https rules, not possible with API in R81.20; available on R82
    - don't inspect outbound traffic (action: bypass)
    - source: apache-dmz and sms
    - updates.checkpoint.com is automatically bypassed

## Import the User Check Certificate
In this step we will import the Check Point ICA certificate and also distribute that using group policy
- From branch1-1 or manager browse to https://192.168.101.1
  - You will receive an untrusted certificate message
  - View the certificate and Export/Copy to File
  - Save as type: `DER Encoded Binary X.509 (*.cer)`
  - Name as you wish
- Copy the file to DC-1 (e.g., copy to \\file-1\it\ and access it from there)
- Import the certificate to the GPO for trusted certificates
  - Open Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)
    - Start > Group Policy Management
    - Forest: xcpng.lab
    - Domain: xcpng.lab
    - OU: Distribute Root CA Certication
    - Right click the OU from the tree, and click Edit
    - In the console tree, open Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Public Key Policies
    - Right-click Trusted Root Certification Authorities, and then click Import
      - By default the certificate you exported is a .der file; select all file types to see the certificate you downloaded
      - Import the file
- You can now view User Check pages correctly
  - "gpupdate /force" will trigger an update
  - logging out and back in may also help

## Change website categorization to Hold mode
By default URl categorization occurs in the background. First attempts to a previously unkown URL will cucceed until Check Point ThreatCloud decides it should be blocked. For this lab we will configure it to hold (block until the categorization is complete.
- Log in to SmartConsole
- MANAGE & SETTINGS > Blades > Application Control & URL Filtering > Advanced Settings
- Click Check Point online web service
- Change Website categorization mode to **Hold**
- Click OK, publish, and install policy
