  - confirm VGA is enabled
  - increase Video RAM to 16MB
- Power off the VM
- Open the console tab
- Start the virtual machine
  - as soon as possible, keep continuously pressing F2 until the UEFI setup screen appears
  - this may take a few tries
- Open **Device Manager**
- Open **OVMF Platform Configuration**
- Select **Change Preferred**
- Select the preferred resolution you want (1440 x 900 for example)
  - 1366 x 768 - don't use - scrambled video in Lab testing
  - 1440 x 900
  - 1600 x 900
  - 1920 x 1080
- Select **Commit Changes and Exit**
- Press **Esc**
