# Install Lab VM
Next we will install our first VM(s). These are on the Inside/LAN network, located behind our VyOS router.

Instuctions are provided for a few different systems you might want to install.

NOTE You will need to upload/copy the appropriate ISO file to one of the SR's (storage repositories) configured earlier

IMPORTANT Currently the VyOS router is using NAT to access the outside world. This means that the rest of the hosts in my Lab can't get to the 192.168.100.0/24 network. Buuut the inside network 192.168.100.0/24 can reach the Internet and the rest of my Lab network (NAS, printer, etc).
