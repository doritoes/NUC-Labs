# Install Nautobot
This corresponds to chapter 3 in the book. The passwords used in the Lab are weak and are only suitable for Lab use. Use secure authentication in production. In this Lab, I used Nautobot 2.3.12 with Django 4.2.16.

## Network Architecture
For this Lab you can install in your home lab network.

## Install Ubuntu Server
The first step is to install Ubuntu Server, upon which we will install Nautobot. This lab was primarily tested on VMware Workstation Pro.

See the tutorial https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview

### Option 1 - NUC
- Download the [latest ISO file](https://ubuntu.com/download/server)
  - For this Lab we are using Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS
- Create a bootable USB stick from the ISO
  - üí°[balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher) is recommended to create a bootable USB stick from the ISO
  - If your workstation is Windows, the Portable version is perfect for the task
  - Click **Flash from file** and select the downloaded ISO file
  - Click **Select target** and select the the USB stick you inserted
  - Click **Flash!** and allow the command shell to continue
  - Wait for the flash and verification to complete
  - Safely eject the USB stick (yes, there are two "drives" on the USB stick) ([tip](Appendix_Safely_Eject.md))
- Boot the NUC from the bootable USB stick
  - Connect to keyboard, mouse and power
    - Optionally connect to wired network for faster setup
  - Insert the USB stick
  - Reboot or power on the NUC
  - Press F10 at the boot prompt
  - Select the USB stick (USB UEFI)
- Follow the prompts to install Ubuntu on the NUC

### Option 2 - VM
- Download the [latest ISO file](https://ubuntu.com/download/server)
  - For this Lab we are using Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS, and the file name is similar to `ubuntu-24.04.1-live-server-amd64.iso`
- Create a new VM that is based on the ISO we downloaded
  - There are a lot of options: VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox, proxmox, XCP-ng, etc.
    - For example, on VMware Workstation Pro:
      - File > New Virtual Machine
      - Typical
      - Browse to select the ISO file you downloaded (it will automatically detect the distribution and version)
      - Name: nautobot
      - Disk: 80GB or more (not aware of a minimum value)
      - Customize Hardware
        - Memory: 2GB or more (testing 4GB in Lab)
        - vCPU: 2 or more (testing 4 in the Lab)
        - Network Adapter: Bridged, connect at power on

### Initial Ubuntu Server Installation
- Allow the system to come up to the "Install" screen and click **Install Ubuntu**
- Accept the language settings and optionally update the installer
- Accept the keyboard settings then accept **Ubuntu Server**
- Accept or configure the network connection (DHCP is fine for this Lab, but in production you want a fixed IP address: either a static IP or use a DHCP reservation)
- No proxy, and continue after the mirror passes tests
- Accept the entire disk and default settings
- **Edit** the root partition to use all the available space
  - ubutntu-lv [...] mounted at /
  - Edit it
    - Change size to the maximum size (i.e., 77.996G)
    - Save
- Done and then Continue
- Enter system and user information *you can modify these as desired*
  - Your name: **nauto**
  - Server name: **nautobot**
  - Username: **nauto**
  - Password: **nautolab5**
  - Require password to log in
  - Continue
- Skip Ubuntu Pro
- Select Install Don't select any feature server snaps, Done
- Wait patiently for the **Installation complete!** message
- Select **Reboot Now**
  - Remove the installation media (USB stick or ISO file) when prompted and press **Enter**

## Set up System
These steps are performed while logged in to `nautobot`

### Update Packages
Update the system packages
- `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt autoremove -y`

### System Dependencies
Nautobot is a django application (runs on Python).
- `sudo apt install -y git python3 python3-pip python3-venv python3-dev`

### Redis setup
Redis is used to support the task queue. It is also used for cacheing.

Install:
- `sudo apt install -y redis-server
Test: (using default localhost and tcp/6379)
- `redis-cli ping`
- successful test returns `PONG`

### Database (PostgreSQL) setup
PostgreSQL and MySQL are supported. PostgreSQL is used in this Lab. Yes, PostgreSQL uses a lot of back-slashes ("\").

Install:
- `sudo apt install -y postgresql`

Test:
- `sudo -iu postgres psql`
- To exit: `\q`

Set up the Nautobot database:
- `sudo -iu postgres psql`
- `CREATE DATABASE nautobot;`
- `CREATE USER nautobot WITH PASSWORD 'nautobot123';`
- `\connect nautobot`
- `GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO nautobot;`
- `\q`

Test the user:
- `psql --username nautobot --password --host localhost nautobot`
- `\q`

### Install Nautobot
#### Create nautobot system user
It is best practice to run nautobot as a user other than root. This user, `nautobot`, will own files and permissions and services will be configured to run under this account.

Create user:
- `sudo useradd --system --shell /bin/bash --create-home --home-dir /opt/nautobot nautobot`
- üå± need to set the password? or no?

Test:
- `eval echo ~nautobot`
- `ls -l /opt/ | grep nautobot`
  - Should be `drwxr-x---` and `nautobot nautobot`

#### Set up Python virtual environment
A Python virtual environment (virtual env or nenv) is strongly recommended. If you haven't used one yet, you're not alone. But it's not as difficult as you would imagine. This helps created isolated environments tailored to indivuldua procjects, preventing any interference with system packages or other projects.

- Create venv
  - `sudo -u nautobot python3 -m venv /opt/nautobot`
- Configure the `$NAUTOBOT_ROOT` environment variable in the user `.bashrc` file
  - `echo "export NAUTOBOOT_ROOT=/opt/nautobot" | sudo tee -a ~nautobot/.bashrc`
- Test
  - `sudo -ui nautobot`
  - `echo $NAUTOBOT_ROOT`
  - `exit`

### Installing Nautobot
üîë Nautobot should be installed as the `nautobot` user --do <ins>NOT</ins> instal as `root`!
- Log in as user `nautobot`
  - Option 1: set the password for the user: `sudo passwd nautobot` and set it to `nautobot123`
  - Option 2: switch to the user: `sudo -ui nautobot`
- Install `wheel` so Python will use wheel packages when they are available
  - `pip3 install --upgrade pip wheel`
- Install Nautobot
  - `pip3 install nautobot`
    - ‚è≤Ô∏è Allow a couple minutes for it to install. Using wheel means pre-combiled binaries and faster installation.
  - NOTE You can specific the book version like so: `pip3 install nautobot==2.1.4`
  - NOTE You can install addition features (MySQL, LDAP, NAPALM, remote_storage, SSO, etc.) by modifying the pip3 install command
    - `pip3 install nautobot[all]` - in Lab testing, this failed
    - `pip3 install nautobot[napalm,mysqlclient]`
- Test
  - `nautobot-server --version`

### Configure Nautobot
- Initialize Nautobox basic configuration will create the `nautobot_config.py` tool.
  - `nautobot-server init`
    - for this Lab, I don't send installation metrics to the developers
- Test
  - `cat /opt/nautobot/nautobot_config.py`
- Customize `nautobot_config.py`
- Set environment variables
- Database Migrations
- Creat a Nautobot superuser
- Collec Nautobot static files
- Nautobot Check
