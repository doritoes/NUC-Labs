# Dynamic Inventory
Start with a very basic dynamic inventory to esure the inventory and connectivty from Ansible to Nautobot are working.

See the book p. 435-437

## Create dynamic inventory files
### Basic Inventory
1. Download the file [nautobot-inventory-01.yml](ansible/nautobot-inventory-01.yml)
2. Test: `ansible-inventory -i nautobot-inventory-01.yml --list`
### Inventory with Groups by Category
1. Download the file [nautobot-inventory-02.yml](ansible/nautobot-inventory-02.yml)
2. Test: `ansible-inventory -i nautobot-inventory-02.yml --list`
### Inventory of "Firewall" Devices
1. Download the file [nautobot-inventory-03.yml](ansible/nautobot-inventory-03.yml)
2. Test: `ansible-inventory -i nautobot-inventory-03.yml --list`

ðŸŒ± Need to determine the next steps
- by default there is one platform in nautobot, `Linux`, which has no Napalm driver attached
- When adding a device, adding a platform with a a working Napalm driver is the best choice
  - Drivers that might match our lab
    - netgear_prosafe (this line is https:// managed not ssh managed)
    - ubiquiti_unifiswitch
    - ubiquiti_airos (not convinced this matches our version of access points)
    - generic
    - linux
  - Missing drivers
    - Synology NAS, try Linux
    - pfSense, try Linux

## Create Platforms to Enable Automation
ðŸŒ± This is in early testing. Not sure if this compatible at all.

1. Download the file [15-platforms.yml](ansible/15-platforms.yml.yml)
2. Test: `ansible-playbook 15-platforms.yml`


## Next Steps
ðŸŒ± Needs a LOT OF WORK!

1. Need to create the dynamic group to bind the Ubiquiti switches to the platform and driver needed
2. Want to try to create dynamic group for pfSense firewall to the platform and driver needed
3. Want to try connecting to the devices using the nautobot credentials
4. Want to try backups
5. Want to try VyOS router
