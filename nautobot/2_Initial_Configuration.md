# Initial Configuration

ðŸ““ This page needs development

This corresponds to the latter part of chapters 3 and 10 in the book. See https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Network-Automation-with-Nautobot

You can't create objects without the required fields. So we need to do some pre-work to get things set up before we start creatings things.

## Create API token for CRUD Operations
- Log in to your nautobot instance
  - e.g., http://192.168.99.14:8001
  - admin/nautobot123
- Click **admin** in the lower-left corner (your logged-in user)
- Click **Profile**
- Click **API Tokens**
- Click **+ Add a Token**
  - Optionally specify a key name (e.g., `nautobot-lab-token-crud-123456789-abcdefghij`) and/or a description
- Click Create
- Click Copy to copy the key name and record it for later use
- Add token to environment variable NAUTOBOT_TOKEN
  - echo "export NAUTOBOT_TOKEN=<<tokenvalue>>" | tee -a ~nautobot/.bashrc
- Add the NAUTOBOT_URL environment variable
  -  echo "export NAUTOBOT_URL=http://localhost:8001" | tee -a ~nautobot/.bashrc
- Log out and back in, you will have the token stored in the envrironment variable
  - or run `source .bashrc`

## Device Prerequisites
To set up the first devices you need to do some steps before finally creating the devices.
- Devices (Step 7)
  - Role (Step 1)
  - Device Type (Step 3)
    - Manufacturer (Step 2)
  - Location (Step 5)
    - Location Type (Step 4)
  - Status (6)

Device Families can be optionally used to group similar device types.

## Roles
Represents the logical role a device might have. Examples follow:
- leaf
- spine
- core router
- access switch
- border router

Some common roles you might have in your home lab are provided. Import these.

### Manually
- From the left menu expand **ORGANIZATION**
- Under **METADATA** click **Roles**
- Click the <ins>drop down</ins> for Add Role
- Click **Import from CSV**
  - Option 1: Use the prepared file [roles.csv](roles.csv)
    - content_types (required) *usually dcim.device*
    - name (required)
    - color (optional)
    - description (optional)
    - weight (optional)

### Using Ansible
1. Copy the playbook [01-roles.yml](ansible/01-roles.yml)
2. Copy the prepared CSV file [roles.csv](roles.csv)
3. Run the playboook `ansible-playbook 01-roles.yml`

## Manufacturers
Represents the name of a device's manufacturer. Used in Device Types.

Examples follow:
- Cisco
- Arista
- Juniper

### Manually
- From the left menu expand **DEVICES**
- Click **Manufacturers**
- Click the <ins>drop down</ins> for Add Manufacturer
- Click **Import from CSV**
  - Option 1: Use the prepared file in this lab: [manufacturers.csv](manufacturers.csv)
  - Option 2:
    - Use the provided script [scrape-manufacturers.py](scrape-manufacturers.py) to collect the latest list yourself
    - Log in as `nautobot` in its home directory
    - `git clone https://github.com/nautobot/devicetype-library`
    - `python3 scrape-manufacturers.py`
    - The file `manufacturers.csv` is created in the home directory
    - Then add any additional manufacturers missing from the list
      - Asus

### Using Ansible
1. Copy the playbook [02-manufacturers.yml](ansible/02-manufacturers.yml)
2. Copy the prepared CSV file [manufacturers.csv](manufacturers.csv) or create your own (see above)
3. Run the playboook `02-manufacturers.yml`

## Device Families
Represents a group of related device types. Optionally used in Device Types.

For example:
- Device family: Cat9000
- Device types:
  - Cat9200
  - Cat9300

Not used in this Lab.

## Device Types
Represents the model of the device, which determines characteristics like interfaces. Examples follow:
- DCS-7010T-48-F (from Arista)
- MX480 (from Juniper)

Required fields:
- Manufacturer (e.g. Cisco)
- Model (e.g. A900-IAMC)
- Height (1, check Is full depth)
