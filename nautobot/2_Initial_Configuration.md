# Initial Configuration
This corresponds to the latter part of chapter 3 in the book. See https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Network-Automation-with-Nautobot

You can't create objects without the required fields. So we need to do some pre-work to get things set up before we start creatings things.

## Device Prerequisites
To set up the first devices you need to do some steps before finally creating the devices.
- Devices (Step 7)
  - Role (Step 1)
  - Device Type (Step 3)
    - Manufacturer (Step 2)
  - Location (Step 5)
    - Location Type (Step 4)
  - Status (6)

what about device families?

## Roles
Represents the logical role a device might have. Examples follow:
- leaf
- spine
- core router
- access switch
- border router

Import
- From the left menu expand **ORGANIZATION**
- Under **METADATA** click **Roles**
- Click the <ins>drop down</ins> for Add Role
- Click **Import from CSV**
  - Option 1: Use the prepared file ðŸŒ± [roles.csv](roles.csv)
    - content_types (required)
    - name (required)
    - color (optional)
    - description (optional)
    - weight (optional)

## Manufacturers
Represents the name of a device's manufacturer. Examples follow:
- Cisco
- Arista
- from Juniper

Used in Device Types

Import
- From the left menu expand **DEVICES**
- Click **Manufacturers**
- Click the <ins>drop down</ins> for Add Manufacturer
- Click **Import from CSV**
  - Option 1: Use the prepared file in this lab: [manufacturers.csv](manufacturers.csv)
  - Option 2:
    - Use the provided script [scrape-manufacturers.py](scrape-manufacturers.py) to collect the latest list yourself
    - Log in as `nautobot` in its home directory
    - `git clone https://github.com/nautobot/devicetype-library`
    - `python3 scrape-manufacturers.py`
    - The file `manufacturers.csv` is created in the home directory
- ðŸŒ± in Lab testing, this didn't complete... it just kept running

## Device Families
Represents a group of related device types. Optionally used in Device Types.

For example:
- Device family: Cat9000
- Device types:
  - Cat9200
  - Cat9300

## Device Types
Represents the model of the device, which determines characteristics like interfaces. Examples follow:
- DCS-7010T-48-F (from Arista)
- MX480 (from Juniper)

Required fields:
- Manufacturer (e.g. Cisco)
- Model (e.g. A900-IAMC)
- Height (1, check Is full depth)


TIP Import from community library https://github.com/nautobot/devicetype-library

Import
- From the left menu expance **DEVICES**
- Click **Device Types**
- Click the <ins>drop down</ins> for Add Device Type
- Click **Import from JSON/YAML (single record)**
  - Navigate https://github.com/nautobot/devicetype-library/tree/main/device-types to find the vendor and device type
  - Inside the vendor file, find the device type yaml file
    - Example: Netgear GS116Ev2.yaml
  - Paste the data into the Data field and click **Submit** or **Submit and Import Another**
- Click **Import from CSV (multiple records)**
  - Content type: dcim | device type (default)
  - Choose File and click **Run Job Now**

ðŸŒ± will test once manufacturers are imported

## Location Types


## Locations
Represents the site where the device is installed. Some examples:
- a city
- a building
- a room

## Statuses
Represents the status of a device. Comes with prepopulated list and you can add your own. Examples follow:
- Active
- Decomissioning
- Planned
