# Initial Configuration
This corresponds to the latter part of chapters 3 and 10 in the book. See https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Network-Automation-with-Nautobot

You can't create objects without the required fields. So we need to do some pre-work to get things set up before we start creatings things.

## Create API token for CRUD Operations
- Log in to your nautobot instance
  - e.g., http://192.168.99.14:8001
  - admin/nautobot123
- Click **admin** in the lower-left corner (your logged-in user)
- Click **Profile**
- Click **API Tokens**
- Click **+ Add a Token**
  - Optionally specify a key name (e.g., `nautobot-lab-token-crud-123456789-abcdef`) and/or a description
- Click **Create**
- Click **Copy** to copy the key name and record it for later use
- Add token to environment variable NAUTOBOT_TOKEN
  - echo "export NAUTOBOT_TOKEN=<<tokenvalue>>" | tee -a ~nautobot/.bashrc
- Add the NAUTOBOT_URL environment variable
  -  echo "export NAUTOBOT_URL=http://localhost:8001" | tee -a ~nautobot/.bashrc
- Log out and back in, you will have the token stored in the envrironment variable
  - or run `source .bashrc`

## Device Prerequisites
To set up the first devices you need to do some steps before finally creating the devices.
- Devices (Step 7)
  - Role (Step 1)
  - Device Type (Step 3)
    - Manufacturer (Step 2)
  - Location (Step 5)
    - Location Type (Step 4)
  - Status (6)

Device Families can be optionally used to group similar device types.

## Roles
Represents the logical role a device might have. Examples follow:
- leaf
- spine
- core router
- access switch
- border router

Some common roles you might have in your home lab are provided. Import these.

### Manually
- From the left menu expand **ORGANIZATION**
- Under **METADATA** click **Roles**
- Click the <ins>drop down</ins> for Add Role
- Click **Import from CSV**
  - Option 1: Use the prepared file [roles.csv](roles.csv)
    - content_types (required) *usually dcim.device*
    - name (required)
    - color (optional)
    - description (optional)
    - weight (optional)

### Using Ansible
1. Copy the playbook [01-roles.yml](ansible/01-roles.yml)
2. Copy the prepared CSV file [roles.csv](roles.csv)
3. Run the playboook `ansible-playbook 01-roles.yml`

## Manufacturers
Represents the name of a device's manufacturer. Used in Device Types.

Examples follow:
- Cisco

- Click **Import from CSV**
  - Option 1: Use the prepared file in this lab: [manufacturers.csv](manufacturers.csv)
  - Option 2:
    - Use the provided script [scrape-manufacturers.py](scrape-manufacturers.py) to collect the latest list yourself
    - Log in as `nautobot` in its home directory
    - `git clone https://github.com/nautobot/devicetype-library`
    - `python3 scrape-manufacturers.py`
    - The file `manufacturers.csv` is created in the home directory
    - Then add any additional manufacturers missing from the list
      - Asus

### Using Ansible
1. Copy the playbook [02-manufacturers.yml](ansible/02-manufacturers.yml)
2. Copy the prepared CSV file [manufacturers.csv](manufacturers.csv) or create your own (see above)
3. Run the playboook `ansible-playbook 02-manufacturers.yml`

## Device Families
Represents a group of related device types. Optionally used in Device Types.

For example:
- Device family: Cat9000
- Device types:
  - Cat9200
  - Cat9300

Not used in this Lab.

## Device Types
Represents the model of the device, which determines characteristics like interfaces. Examples follow:
- DCS-7010T-48-F (from Arista)
- MX480 (from Juniper)

Required fields:
- Manufacturer (e.g. Cisco)
- Model (e.g. A900-IAMC)

### Manually
- From the left menu expance **DEVICES**
- Click **Device Types**
- Click the <ins>drop down</ins> for Add Device Type
- Click **Import from JSON/YAML (single record)**
  - Navigate https://github.com/nautobot/devicetype-library/tree/main/device-types to find the vendor and device type
  - Inside the vendor file, find the device type yaml file
    - Example: Netgear GS116Ev2.yaml
  - Paste the data into the Data field and click **Submit** or **Submit and Import Another**
- Click **Import from CSV (multiple records)**
  - Content type: dcim | device type (default)
  - Choose File and click **Run Job Now**
- In my Lab I imported the following (provided in this repo)
  - [Netgear GS110TPv3.yaml](device-types/GS110TPv3.yaml)
  - [Netgear GS116Ev2.yaml](device-types/GS116Ev2.yaml) ([official](https://github.com/nautobot/devicetype-library/blob/main/device-types/Netgear/GS116Ev2.yaml))
  - [Unifi USW-Lite-16-PoE.yaml](device-types/USW-Lite-16-PoE.yaml) ([official](https://github.com/nautobot/devicetype-library/blob/main/device-types/Ubiquiti/USW-Lite-16-PoE.yaml))
  - [Unifi UAP-FlexHD.yaml](device-types/UAP-FlexHD.yaml) ([official](https://github.com/nautobot/devicetype-library/blob/main/device-types/Ubiquiti/UAP-FlexHD.yaml))
  - [Unifi U7-Pro.yaml](device-types/U7-Pro.yaml)
  - [Synology DS224+.yaml](device-types/DS224+.yaml)
  - [Qotom Q555G6-S05.yaml](device-types/Q555G6-S05.yaml)
    - Qotom-Q555G6-S05 Qotom Mini PC Intel Core i5 7200U Industrial Micro PC Barebone System Dual Core Desktop Small Computer with 6 Gigabit Ethernet NIC; used as firewall running pfSense
  - Intel NUC NUC10i7FNH1 Intel Core i7-10710U  ([NUC10i7FNH1.yaml)[device-types/NUC10i7FNH1.yaml])
    - running proxymox
  - Asus NUC NUC14RVH ([NUC14RVH.yaml](device-types/NUC14RVH.yaml)) ðŸŒ± added ASUS manufacturer to manufacturers.csv
    - running XCP-ng

### Using Ansible
Due to the nesting of that interface data in the yaml devicetype files:
- it's easy to parse a directory of yaml files and create the device types without interface information
- it's hard to do the same and add the interfaces
- it's mind-bending to try and do it in with Ansible without processing the data

Therefore there is a two-step process
1. Create the devicetypes without interfaces
  1. Copy the playbook [03-device-types.yml](ansible/03-device-types.yml)
  2. Create a subdirectory named "devicetypes" and copy all the device types you want to import there
     1. [Netgear GS110TPv3.yaml](device-types/GS110TPv3.yaml)
     2. [Netgear GS116Ev2.yaml](device-types/GS116Ev2.yaml) ([official](https://github.com/nautobot/devicetype-library/blob/main/device-types/Netgear/GS116Ev2.yaml))
     3. [Unifi USW-Lite-16-PoE.yaml](device-types/USW-Lite-16-PoE.yaml) ([official](https://github.com/nautobot/devicetype-library/blob/main/device-types/Ubiquiti/USW-Lite-16-PoE.yaml))
     4. [Unifi UAP-FlexHD.yaml](device-types/UAP-FlexHD.yaml) ([official](https://github.com/nautobot/devicetype-library/blob/main/device-types/Ubiquiti/UAP-FlexHD.yaml))
     5. [Unifi U7-Pro.yaml](device-types/U7-Pro.yaml)
     6. [Synology DS224+.yaml](device-types/DS224+.yaml)
     7. [Qotom Q555G6-S05.yaml](device-types/Q555G6-S05.yaml) - Qotom-Q555G6-S05 Qotom Mini PC Intel Core i5 7200U Industrial Micro PC Barebone System Dual Core Desktop Small Computer with 6 Gigabit Ethernet NIC; used as firewall running pfSense
     8. [NUC10i7FNH1.yaml](device-types/NUC10i7FNH1.yaml) - Intel NUC NUC10i7FNH1 Intel Core i7-10710U - running proxymox
     9. [NUC14RVH.yaml](device-types/NUC14RVH.yaml) Asus NUC NUC14RVH - ðŸŒ± added ASUS manufacturer to manufacturers.csv - running XCP-ng
     10. Find more at https://github.com/nautobot/devicetype-library/tree/main/device-types
  4. Run the playboook `ansible-playbook 03-device-types.yml`
2. Create a CSV file, extracting the data from the yaml files and preparing it for Ansible device_interface_template
  1. Copy the Python script [scrape-device-types-interfaces.py](scrape-device-types-interfaces.py)
  2. Run the script `python3 scrape-device-types-interfaces.py`
    - scrapes the devicetypes folder
    - reads all the devicetype names (model name) from all the yaml files
    - creates a CSV file ready for Ansible
3. Add the interfaces to the devicetypes
  1. Copy the playbook [04-device-types-interfaces.yml](ansible/04-device-types-interfaces.yml)
  2. Run the playboook `ansible-playbook 04-device-types-interfaces.yml`
