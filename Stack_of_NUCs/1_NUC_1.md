# NUC 1

This is the first NUC in our ["Stack of NUCs"](https://www.unclenuc.com/lab:stack_of_nucs:start)
- user-friendly desktop installation
- workstation to operate the lab and other NUCs from
- used to create the rest of the environment
  - create modified ISO for the boot USB stick
  - create boot USB stick for the new ISO
  - create CIDATA USB stick
  - create firmware upgrade USB stick
  - create SSH management keys
  - connect to the other NUCs you build

Hardware:
- Intel NUC model [BOXNUC7i3BNK](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/95069/intel-nuc-kit-nuc7i3bnk.html)
- 16GB RAM (8GB is my recommendation)
- 128GB storage (64GB is my recommendation; at 32GB you will run low on disk space)
