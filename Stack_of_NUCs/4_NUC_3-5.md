# Set up NUC 3, NUC 4, and more
In this step you will configure your remaining NUCs in the stack as more servers, the Ansible member modes. We will update the CIDATA USB stick and use it to build the remaining NUCs in the stack.

Hardware:
- [D34010WYK](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/76978/intel-nuc-kit-d34010wyk/specifications.html) - i3
  - https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/17536/bios-update-wylpt10h.html
  - 8 GB RAM
  - 32 GB or more storage
  - Wireless card

Software:
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS server

Purpose:
- Ansible worker nodes

## Modify the CIDATA USB stick for the Ansible Nodes
These steps are performed while logged in to NUC1
- Insert the CICDATA USB stick into NUC1
  - The USB stick will mount automatically
- Modify the user-data file on CIDATA
  - Download the example file: [user-data-ansible](user-data-ansible-node)
  - Edit the file using a text editor (notepadqq was installed earlier) to edit `user-data-ansible-node` in your Downloads folder
    - ⚠️ Replace the WiFi SSID name and PASSWORD with your WiFi SSID and passphrase
    - ⚠️ Replace the key(s) in the example for the user **tux** with the output from **NUC1** for `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
    - ⚠️ Replace the key(s) in the example for the user **ansible** with the output from **NUC2** (logged in as user ansible) for `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
- You can now safely remove the USB stick ([tip](https://help.ubuntu.com/stable/ubuntu-help/files-removedrive.html.en))

### Experiment with your NUCs Lab
Here are some things you can experiment with now.
- Test logging in (for now you will need to manually accept the keys; we will add those automatically later)
  - from NUC 1 logged in as tux
    - `ssh tux@[IP NUC3]`
    - `exit back to NUC 1`
    - `ssh ansible@[IP NUC3]`
    - exit back to NUC 1
  - from NUC 2 logged in as ansible
    - `ssh [IP NUC3]`
- Test running ad hoc Ansible commands from NUC 2 to NUC 3
  - Add the IP address of NUC 3 to the inventory
    - File: /home/ansible/my-project/hosts
    - Under [nodes] add the IP address
  - Run some test Ansible ad hoc commands
    - `ansible -i hosts all –list-hosts`
    - `ansible -i hosts all -m ping`
    - `ansible -i hosts nodes -m ping`
    - `ansible -i hosts all -a "/sbin/reboot"`
      - in my testing I get a connection refused message as the NUC reboots
      - after it comes back up you can confirm it rebooted by looking at the uptime
      - `ansible -i hosts all -a "/usr/bin/uptime"`
    - `ansible -i hosts all -m ansible.builtin.setup # see all facts`
  - Optionally, take the NUC 3 IP address back out of the inventory file “hosts”
