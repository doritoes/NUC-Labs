# Kubernetes Installation
Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Now we are going to use Ansible to install Kubernetes with:
- one NUC "master node" this we can call NUC 3
- remaining NUCs as "worker nodes" on which containerized applications will run

Purpose:
- Demonstrate a running a complex workload of web applications on Kubernetes
